# In-Class Notes:

## Project scraping:

* Philosphically, you have a question and data,
what do you do now?
   - What factors drive accidents with large vehicles (i.e. trucks)?

* Relationships between variables one of which is the size of the 
vehicle.
* Determining outcome variables vs. independent variables

> (Dependent variable/explanitory on Y-axis)
>
> (Independent variable on X-axis)
>
> E.g.
>
> X = age of driver
> 	- consider increments
>
> Y = liklihood of fatal crash [0-1 scale]

* In the crash data there is a flag for fatality count.
	- Use the data dictionary for crash data to filter
	and investigate topics

* Filter the count of accidents involving a particular age to create a proportion of those which involved fatalities over the total.

* Tools (visualizing outcome variable of interest):
	- Sample plot
	- Cause/Effect mapping - nodes based of center (coded)

* OpenRefine to help clean up data
	- (See the videos (Posted by both Eric and Coral for how to use))

**Additional graphs/notes handwritten**

[PA crash data (1997 - Current)](https://data.pa.gov/Public-Safety/Crash-Incident-Details-CY-1997-Current-Annual-Coun/dc5b-gebx)

## To do for next week (2020-04-11):

* Determine primary dataset (fallback PA crash data)
* Identify a "first pass" inquiry question
* Create cause/effect flow chart which identifies your outcome variables and independent variables
    - Investigate type & variation range of each variable of interest
    - Do we have enough data reported?
    - What would be the analsis data type? i.e. even if original data set type is txt, what would I anticipate the end-variable type becoming after cleaning and transforming? (Use OpenRefine to clean/code data)
* Install OpenRefine and watch tutorial videos (3 total)

## Next Week (2020-04-11):

* Cleaning data in OpenRefine
